# Bug_World
## Introduction
MyBugWorld is a JavaFX-based interactive simulation that models a virtual environment of bugs and plants. It allows users to observe and interact with moving bugs, represented by graphical images, in a dynamic world. The application demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and event handling using the JavaFX framework.
## Features
**Bug Simulation**: The app simulates different types of bugs, such as ladybirds, that move around the screen.

**Plant Generation**: Plants are randomly generated within the environment, creating a natural-looking habitat for the bugs.

**User Interaction**: Users can interact with bugs by clicking on them, triggering specific events like removal from the screen and displaying messages.

**Dynamic Animation**: The application uses a timeline to animate bug movements, making the simulation lively and interactive.
